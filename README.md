<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This split screen game has a single player controlling two soul-bound heroes, an Angel and a Devil, who have agreed to work together to save Earth. The two characters have a melee and a ranged attack each which creates the need for the player to divide their attention in this difficult, timing-based combat game.. The game spawns enemies in waves with an increasing rate and a randomized pattern thereby increasing the difficulty for players. The story for the game concept follows the armies of Heaven and Hell going to war threatening to destroy Earth in the process. This game was created in 48 hours and was submitted for the Global Game Jam in 2022.

## Game Mechanics

The game focuses on gun play and movement. Players can pickup different weapons, ammo, and health items.

* Movement: Players can use 'AD' keys to move both players simultaneously.
* Player combat: Both players have a different combat range. The top player attacks at melee range, whereas the bottom player fires projectiles.
* Enemies: Enemies spawn from either side of the screen on both halves and attack players at melee range.
